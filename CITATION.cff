abstract: >
  Structural Messaging defines how runtime payload and structural evidence are jointly transmitted,
  validated, and frozen into reproducible system states in Structural Intelligence runtime systems.
  The release includes a conceptual specification (v0.1.1), an architecture explanation document
  (DBM-COT ITEM #266, bilingual), example message instances (JSON), and a minimal Java demo with tests.
notes: >
  Quantum entanglement is used only as a theoretical analogy to illustrate the extreme limit of constrained communication.
  No quantum implementation claim is made.
