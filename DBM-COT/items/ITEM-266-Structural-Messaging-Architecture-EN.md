ITEM #266 — Structural Messaging Architecture in DBM-SI

Date: 2026-02-14

Structural Messaging defines how runtime payload and structural evidence travel together
inside a Structural Intelligence system.

StructuralMessage = Payload + StructuralContext

Structural Messaging originates from constrained communication scenarios where payload
cannot be transmitted directly and must instead be encoded through shared structural
conventions.

Bridge signaling demonstrates minimal‑bandwidth structural encoding.
Trigger‑based observation shows that receivers should only observe structurally meaningful moments.
The quantum‑entanglement analogy illustrates the theoretical limit of constrained communication.

Runtime Flow:
Algorithm → EvidenceChain → Validator → EvidenceMessage → ExecutionReceipt → Snapshot → ConvergenceChecker

Structural Messaging is not bound to a transport medium.
It is bound to structural state synchronization.
