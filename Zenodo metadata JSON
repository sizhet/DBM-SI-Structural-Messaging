  "title": "DBM-SI Structural Messaging: Payload-Structure Communication Model",
  "upload_type": "software",
  "description": "DBM-SI Structural Messaging defines the communication model through which runtime payload and structural evidence are jointly transmitted, validated, and frozen into reproducible system states in Structural Intelligence systems.\n\nUnlike conventional messaging systems that transport data alone, Structural Messaging carries payload together with structural context — including evidence chains, invariant hashes, execution status, and snapshot references — ensuring that structural intelligence execution remains auditable, reproducible, and verifiable across runtime boundaries.\n\nThis repository contains: (1) a conceptual specification (StructuralMessaging-Spec v0.1.1), (2) an architecture explanation document (DBM-COT ITEM #266, bilingual), (3) example message instances (JSON), and (4) a minimal Java reference demo with unit tests.\n\nNote: Quantum entanglement is used only as a theoretical analogy to illustrate the extreme limit of constrained communication. No quantum implementation claim is made.",
